# nike_app

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

Welcome to my GitHub repository where I have built a Nike E-commerce User Interface (UI) using Flutter and Dart. This project showcases a sleek and modern interface for an online store, with a focus on a smooth user experience and intuitive design.

The Nike E-commerce UI includes basic functionalities such as adding an item to the cart and removing it, making it easy for users to shop and manage their purchases.
